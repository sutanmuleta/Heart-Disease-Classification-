# Heart Disease EKG Prediction Scenario and Impact Analysis

## Project Overview

This project uses a classification model** to predict whether a patient’s electrocardiogram (EKG) result is normal or abnormal.  
I used the UCI Heart Disease dataset and tested changes in patient data would affect the model’s predictions.

###  Scenario Analysis

I created three scenarios to see how the model reacts when health features change:

## | Scenarios  |

 **Aging Population** 
 **Healthier Lifestyle** 
 **Economic Stress** 

### Sensitivity Analysis

I tested how sensitive the model is to **age** vs **cholesterol** changes.

## Results Summary

- **More abnormal EKG predictions when patients are older**
- **Slight increase in abnormal EKG predictions even when lowering blood pressure (unexpected)**
- **No change in predictions when cholesterol increases**
